      <description>Every developer should be comfortable with curl.
For the same reason that you should at least be conversational in tools like sed, awk, and vi, you should be able to quickly type in something like like curl -v localhost:8080 to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on. It&amp;rsquo;s available on just about every unix-based box for a good reason.
Like its man page states, the number of features will make your head spin. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the most discussed reason people are turned off by it.</description>
