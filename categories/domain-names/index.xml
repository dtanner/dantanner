      <description>Though the biggest domain name purchases are probably long-gone since the initial dot-com boom, they still remain a valued property. They&amp;rsquo;ll never be as valuable as real land of course, since we can always create more of them, as opposed to things like lake-front property.
The recent mad rush for facebook profile names reminded me of this new global scale of gold rush activity. And yes, I&amp;rsquo;m a little annoyed that someone that has been farming this interweb as long as I have was offered a name like dan.</description>
