      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a great family camp my family has attended over the years. We spend a week on a beautiful lake with good friends, pawn our children off for a few hours each day, and disconnect from the world.
It started as a tiny little family camp decades ago, and is now so popular there&amp;rsquo;s a lottery system held each winter to determine who gets in for the summer.
The lottery process has some major flaws though, and gives a sour taste to an otherwise well-executed operation.</description>
