      <description>A few months ago, I promised Maria that I would get her and Daniela a playhouse for their birthdays. I was originally going to buy them a little Step2 playhouse, which would&amp;rsquo;ve been totally fine. But my good friend Rob, a skilled woodworker, convinced me that building a playhouse was the way to go. I was a little tentative about the idea, since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t built a real structure before on my own, but he very generously offered to help (and with two kids of his own, meant that his wife Karen also very generously helped&amp;hellip;we still can&amp;rsquo;t thank them enough!</description>
