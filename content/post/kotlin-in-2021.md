maybe organize this as listing a few things and say "you could stop here and make a reasonable argument that these 
features alone make the switch worth it."

another way to phrase is it, what things will java probably never have?



## Features that make code more reliable
null safety 
immutability as the norm

## Some of my favorite features
using functions as injected dependencies
collection functional features
    filter
    map
    take
    fold
    reduce

extension functions - AKA 1-liner DSLs
.with et al
IDE support
default arguments
named arguments
data classes and .copy()
string interpolation
sealed classes

## The most common complaint I hear
spock data testing

## Things that still trip me up
coroutines
advanced generics

## compared to groovy
