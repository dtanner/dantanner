Subject: Propaganda Guide on Domestic vs Foreign Human Resources<br>


Welcome! If you're reading this, you're a corporate leader looking to maximize shareholder value!

The recent pandemic has resulted in an unfortunate incident regarding human resource management. What was intended to be a temporary location adjustment to preserve resource vitality and productivity has been mistakenly interpreted as a permanent "situation".

We want you to know that we care deeply about this problem, and are here to help you guide your proverbial "domestic sheep" back to the "flock" ;-)

It is also critical to project a positive image regarding our global human resource market, given their favorable terms of resource management. But how does a leader convince one group of resources that they need to "come home", while managing another group of autonomous resources across the world?

So many talking points - it's hard to keep track of them all! With that in mind, we've prepared a communication guide for you to share with your resources and other asset owners. Be sure to read it carefully and communicate the appropriate message with the right resource. You don't want to get your wires crossed on this one, as the same topic results in different guidance based on your audience!

## \*Sigh\*

The idea for this article started when I entered the following two queries into Claude:

- What top five reasons are large corporations giving to justify their return to office shift?
- What top five reasons are large corporations giving to justify offshore software development?

At least for the offshore development, the first list item was money. It didn't even mention money in the return to office list.

To be clear, I'm not against offshore development. My belief is that it's short-sighted for a capitalist to treat any remote development differently. The hard part is that our industry is so immature that we can barely even *define* quality and productivity, much less *measure* it effectively. My hope is that there'll continue to be enough domestic remote jobs for good companies because they know it's a way to attract the best workers. I know how to get shit done from my home office, and I know how to [wash a dirty cat blanket](https://racketmn.com/minneapolis-mayor-frey-just-called-people-who-work-from-home-losers).

## Who cares what people want?

People want to be able to work remotely for these reasons:

- Flexibility in their day about when they work
- Not wasting 8 hours a week commuting
- Not wasting time in between meetings finding the next space to meet
- Reducing disease vectors
- Shitty setups in office for getting heads-down work done vs their sweet setup at home
- Better lunches than terrible cafeteria food
- Increasing the number of companies that they're a viable employee at
- Getting to work with more diverse folks, not just those that happen to live in the same geographic area

The most difficult and important problems in my field can't be solved by people with mediocre skill regardless of headcount.
There's an enormous gap in ability between developers, and supply of is still extremely scarce.

Want to attract the best people even though you can't compete on salary? Some companies get it.
I hope they continue to succeed and that I can continue to work in greener pastures.
