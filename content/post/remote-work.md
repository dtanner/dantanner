Subject: Communication Guide on Domestic and Foreign Human Software Resources<br>


Welcome! If you're reading this, you're a corporate leader looking to maximize shareholder _value_.

The recent pandemic has resulted in an unfortunate incident regarding human resource management. What was intended to be a temporary location adjustment to preserve resource vitality and productivity has been misinterpreted by some as a permanent situation.

We want you to know that we care deeply about this problem, and are here to help you guide your proverbial "domestic sheep" back to the "flock" ;-)

It is also critical to project a positive image regarding our global software human resource market, given their favorable terms of resource management. But how does a leader convince one group of resources that they need to "come home", while managing another group of autonomous resources across the world?

With that in mind, we've prepared a communication guide for you to share with your software-producing human resources. Be sure to read it carefully and communicate the appropriate message with the right resource. You don't want to get your wires crossed on this one, as the same topic results in different guidance based on your audience!

## I hope that was recognized as sarcasm

The idea for this rant started with these queries:

- What top five reasons are large corporations giving to justify their return to office shift?
- What top five reasons are large corporations giving to justify offshore software development?

At least for the offshore development, the first list item was money. Money wasn't even mentioned in the return to office list.

To be clear, I'm not against offshore development. I see it as a different style of remote work with a different set of advantages and constraints.


## Practical reasons for (domestic) remote work

Some people want to be able to work remotely, and most of those reasons are beneficial to the company as well,
or at least don't negatively impact the company.

The following table illustrates some practical perks for remote work and how they impact the company, whether it's positive (+), negative (-), or no impact (0).

| Perk                                                                                                    | Company Impact | Reason                                               |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| Flexibility in their day about when they work                                                           |       0        | They get the work done and attend necessary meetings |
| Not wasting 8 hours a week commuting                                                                    |       +        | Fresher worker means better work                     |
| Not wasting time in between meetings finding the next space to meet                                     |       +        | Time savings                                         |
| Reducing disease vectors                                                                                |       +        | Healthier workers means more work                    |
| Shitty setups in office for getting heads-down work done vs their sweet setup at home                   |       +        | A better setup means better output                   |
| Better lunches than terrible cafeteria food                                                             |       +        | Happier workers means better work                    |
| Increasing the number of companies that they're a viable employee at                                    |       -        | More competition for workers is bad for owners       |
| Getting to work with more diverse folks, not just those that happen to live in the same geographic area |       +        | More diverse viewpoints create better results        |
| Money saved on commuting                                                                                |       +        | A lower financial burden means less salary pressure  |

### I hope we can make significant correlations based on the policy down the road
Many difficult and important problems can't be solved by people with mediocre skill regardless of headcount.
There's an enormous gap in ability between developers, and the supply of exceptional programmers is still rare.

Supporting remote work can be critical recruiting opportunity for the best talent, especially if that company can't compete financially.
Some companies understand this; I hope they succeed and that others can see their remote-friendly policy played a significant part in the success.
Working remotely is what I hope to do for the rest of my career.
