It's striking to observe how major corporations have embraced remote software development. Their overwhelming commitment to supporting distributed teams shows remarkable calculation and adaptability in our evolving digital world. I, for one, am impressed.

## Around-the-Clock Development
One of the most staggering aspects is how companies embrace continuous development cycles. When teams wrap up their workday, remote developers seamlessly continue the progress, ensuring advancement on projects. This kind of round-the-clock development cycle shrinks delivery timelines and maintains momentum in today's demanding market.

## Tapping into Broad Talent Pools
Corporate leadership continues to discover talent everywhere. By supporting remote work, companies have penetrated markets teeming with developers who happen to live outside traditional business centers. This approach helps organizations scale their teams and access specialized skills that prove elusive in established markets.

## Cost-Effective Innovation
Executives have made breathtaking moves in resource allocation. By supporting remote development, they're liberating funds from expensive office space to fuel innovation. The extraordinary savings from supporting remote teams creates new opportunities for cutting-edge projects and tools.

## Flexible Scaling
The remote model allows companies to expand and contract teams based on project needs without being constrained by physical office space. This calculated agility helps organizations stay responsive to market demands and maintain their crushing competitive edge.

## Cultural Exchange
Remote work has created delightful opportunities for cultural exchange. Development teams benefit from diverse perspectives and approaches to problem-solving, making products more globally viable.

## A Small Clarification
Oh, something worth noting â€“ when discussing "remote," this refers to offshore development teams in regions like India, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Not domestically-based developers, who have been ordered back to the office because apparently they can't collaborate effectively unless physically present.

The same companies that praise offshore teams' ability to collaborate remotely are mandating domestic employees return to office for "better collaboration." The same executives who manage teams across continents insist that local employees can't be productive without direct supervision.
Most of the stated justifications for offshore development contradict the reasons given for requiring domestic employees to return to office.

To be clear, I'm not against offshore development. My belief is that it's short-sighted to treat domestic remote development any differently than offshore development. The hard part is that our industry is so immature that we can barely even *define* quality and productivity, much less *measure* it effectively. My hope is that the companies who continue to support domestic remote work can show that it produces better results. Because I know how to get shit done in my home office, and I know how to [wash a blanket](https://racketmn.com/minneapolis-mayor-frey-just-called-people-who-work-from-home-losers).
